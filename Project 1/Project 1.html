<li>My first impression of this site is that it has lots of information and it is well organized with a clean simple layout. </li>
<li>They have tabs on the left and on the top, as well as blocks of information in the middle of the page with links to articles that have been written. </li>
<li>Yes the site structure makes a lot of sense. It is very clean and simple as it has dropdown menus on the top that you can choose specific things to look at,
as well as some quick links to top destinations, trip planning tools, and places to stay. It presents information clearly to the audience. </li>
<li> The multimedia on this site attracts attention because it has some scenery of Utah, and someone who is specifically looking for things to do in Utah will be attracted by those images and click to learn more. The background of the site is very basic and clean, and the colorful multi-media and layout draws attention. </li>
<li> The home page load time was rather quick. I would say within 1-2 seconds it was all loaded up and ready to go. Very reasonable. </li>
<li> All text is very easy to read and basic colors were chosen to be able to facilitate reading. The light gray background lets the text stand out clearly for readers. </li>
<li> Yes. As mentioned, the site has dropdown navigation menus along the top header that are easy to use and works well. When clicked, the link loads quickly and everything appears to work. </li>
<li> Yes. The styling of the site was kept the same throughout the website. Same header, with a different picture below it followed by the same layout for text underneath with navigation options back to home. Color scheme continues throughout site. </li>
<li> The site is very responsive to different window sizes automatically sizing down to fit everything on the site into the window without needing to side scroll. </li>
<li> This site offers a plethora of information about Utah all in one place and very well done. Instead of searching through many different sites to find information, this site compiles it all into one place with easy navigation. </li>
